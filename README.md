# Express.js Missing Response Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: forgetting to send a response to the client in a request handler. The server starts successfully, but clients receive no response, leading to timeouts or errors.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js server that correctly sets up a route but neglects to send a response using `res.send()` or `res.json()`.  The `console.log` statement shows that the server receives the request, but the client never receives a response.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected code. A response is sent using `res.send()` to resolve the issue.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory in your terminal.
3. Run `node bug.js`. 
4. Try accessing `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser or using a tool like `curl`.  You will notice a lack of response.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js`. 
6. Access the URL again. This time, the server will correctly respond.
